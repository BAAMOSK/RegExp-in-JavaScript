# RegExp-in-JavaScript
Lecture Notes and Examples

This is an outline of a presentation I prepared for classmates in the General Assembly Web Immersive Development course.  In my experience, regular expressions have a particularly forbidding look, but with a minimal effort can become a very valuable tool in a programmer's box.  Reading another's regular expressions is a separate matter, but when it comes to writing them, I suggest that one learn them a little at a time, practicing a new syntax in sample code until one is confident of his or her mastery, then using them in code only when it can be done comfortably.
